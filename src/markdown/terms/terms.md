These Terms and Conditions (“**Terms**”) become part of any contract (“**Agreement**”) between you (“**you**”, “**yours**” or “**User**”) and Protofire (“**we**”, “**our**” or “**us**”) provided we made these Terms accessible to you prior to entering into the Agreement and you consent to these Terms. We are Altoros LLC, a limited liability company registered with the commercial register of Puerto Rico under company number 416164, with its registered office at 1607 Ponce de Leon Avenue, GM-06, San Juan, PR, 00909-1803. You can contact us by writing to safe@protofire.io.

The Agreement is concluded by using the Web App subject to these Terms. The use of our Services is only permitted to legal entities, partnerships and natural persons with unlimited legal capacity. In particular, minors are prohibited from using our Services.

The application of your general terms and conditions is excluded. Your deviating, conflicting or supplementary general terms and conditions shall only become part of the Agreement if and to the extent that Protofire has expressly agreed to their application in writing. This consent requirement shall apply in any case, even if, for example, Protofire, being aware of your general terms and conditions, accepts payments by the contractual partner without reservations.

We reserve the right to change these Terms at any time and without giving reasons, while considering and weighing your interests. The new Terms will be communicated to you in advance. They are considered as agreed upon if you do not object to their validity within 14 days after receipt of the notification. We will separately inform you about the essential changes, the possibility to object, the deadline, and the consequences of inactivity. If you object, the current version of the Terms remains applicable. Our right to terminate the contract according to Clause 13 remains unaffected.
