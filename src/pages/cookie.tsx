    <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
    <p>
      Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize the computer or device used to
      access a website. A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you
      visit the site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font
      size, and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don&apos;t have to keep re-entering them
      whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.
    </p>

    <h2>What are the different types of cookies?</h2>
    <p>A cookie can be classified by its lifespan and the domain to which it belongs.</p>
    <p>By lifespan, a cookie is either a:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Session cookie, which is erased when the user closes the browser; or</li>
      <li>
        Persistent cookie, which is saved to the hard drive and remains on the user&apos;s computer/device for a
        pre-defined period of time.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>As for the domain to which it belongs, cookies are either:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First-party cookies, which are set by the web server of the visited page and share the same domain (i.e. set by
        us); or
      </li>
      <li>Third-party cookies, stored by a different domain to the visited page&apos;s domain.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What cookies do we use and why?</h2>
    <p>We list all the cookies we use on this website in the APPENDIX below.</p>

      <li>
